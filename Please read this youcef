This is the MC project , but due to some things i couldn't finish it and i didn't do the CSS part
most of the project is similar to your html file because i was trying to learn from it so yeah
the only thing i added was the workshops section that u didn't have in the static website
i was gonna skip on the project but i decided to do at least the html part , and finally ill be working on the css part and commiting changes till it looks decent
